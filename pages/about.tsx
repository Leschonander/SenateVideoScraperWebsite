        In the halls of the Senate, there turned out be a specific problem, that there is no central source of committee
        hearings for one to look at. If one wants to search for a given hearing, you have to go the specific committees
        website
      </p>

      <p>Lincoln Network has decidied to solve this.</p>

      <p>
        Along with the scraper maintined <a href="https://github.com/Leschonander/SenateVideoScraper"></a>
        this website on the main page will provide a easy to use interface to search through the various Senate
        committee hearings.
